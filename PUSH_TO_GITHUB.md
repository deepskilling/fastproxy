## 📊 Verify Everything Works

### 1. Check Repository
```bash
# Visit your repository
https://github.com/deepskilling/fastproxy
```

### 2. Verify Badges
The badges in README.md should now display:
- ✅ Build Status (may show "no status" initially until first CI run)
- ✅ Python Version
- ✅ License
- ✅ Code Style

### 3. Trigger First CI Build
Make a small change to trigger GitHub Actions:
```bash
echo "# LiteProxy" > test.md
git add test.md
git commit -m "test: trigger initial CI build"
git push
rm test.md
git add test.md
git commit -m "chore: remove test file"
git push
```

Or simply: **Push any commit** and CI will run automatically.

### 4. Check Actions Tab
```
https://github.com/deepskilling/fastproxy/actions
```
You should see the Python CI workflow running.
